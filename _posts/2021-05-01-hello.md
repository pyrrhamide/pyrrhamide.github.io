This website is built using Jekyll and the `minima` theme, deployed by/on GitHub Pages.

The `index.md` file in the root of the repo serves as the homepage of pyrrhamide.github.io.

The `_config.yml` file in the root of the repo serves to globally define the site (I believe there is a fancier way to say this, I however cannot think of it right now).

The `_posts/` folder contains all posts. I can set `show_excerpts: true` in the configuration file to show a snippet of all posts, in the homepage. Posts are written (at least from what little I've done so far) in Markdown syntax.
