Changes on `bookdown`/GitHub pages:

* fonts: main text - Lato (now Mulish because I change fonts like I change underwear); headers - Zilla Slab,
* links colour (summary, main text, hover) in blue...aquamarine?
* active link + h1 (except title) styled in blue + border left,
* title: larger font.


Issues with `blogdown`/Netlify/Hugo:

* MathJax equations not showing.
