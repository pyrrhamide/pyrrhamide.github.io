I am currently a postgraduate student in Quantified Social Sciences, having previously studied Politics and Quantitative Methods.

I am French. I love tattoos, rugby, reality TV and Swiss army knives.

I started to use R last year, as part of my studies. The learning curve was steep, but once I understood what I was doing, R became a versatile toy (a swiss army knife if you will) rather than just a tool for my degree. I have been experimenting with RMarkdown, creating single HTML pages, in the comfort of my own laptop. I had this ambition of one day publishing a website, because local browsing rapidly became bothersome. I went through with this at the beginning of the year of our Lord two thousand and twenty-one, with the launch of my [personal blog](http://kanto.rbind.io) built with the `blogdown` package, and the following project.

## About this project

A classmate suggested one of our course directors/lecturers creates a syllabus with all the different methods we learned throughout the degree. I actually had done something similar for my personal use, and I figured I might as well improve and share it to help my coursemates out. It brought me back to this idea of a website/blog, which I now proudly present.

I wrote this book with R, RMarkdown and the [`bookdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) package in order to upload some of my study notes. It is still a work in progress and it is not to be taken as a reference. Do feel free to send suggestions.

One last word: the notes are in French.
