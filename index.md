### About moi

I am currently a postgraduate student in Quantified Social Sciences, having previously studied Politics and Quantitative Methods.

I am French. I love tattoos, rugby, reality TV and Swiss army knives.

Last year, as part of my studies, I started to use R. The learning curve was steep, but once I understood what I was doing, I started seeing R as a toy to do lots of different stuff with (a swiss army knife if you will), rather than as a simple tool for my degree. I have been experimenting a lot with RMarkdown, creating single HTML pages, in the comfort of my own laptop. I had this big ambition at the back of my mind, of one day publishing a website. I did not go through this, until the beginning of the year of our Lord two thousand and twenty-one.

One day, a classmate suggested one of our course directors/lecturers creates a syllabus with all the different methods we learned throughout the degree. I actually had done something similar for my personal use, and I figured "why not share it and improve it?". It brought me back to this idea of a website/blog, which I can now share.

### About this project

This has been a little experimentation using R, RMarkdown and bookdown to create a personal blog where I could upload some of my study notes. It is still a work in progress and it is not to be taken as a reference. Do feel free to send suggestions.

One last word: the notes are in French. I love English, but not to the point of translating course content :-)
