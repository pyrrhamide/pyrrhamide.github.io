I am currently a postgraduate student in Quantified Social Sciences, having previously studied Politics and Quantitative Methods.

I am French. I love tattoos, rugby, reality TV and Swiss army knives. Most of all, I love to procrastinate.

Last year, as part of my studies, I started to use R. The learning curve was steep, but once I understood what I was doing, I started seeing R as a toy to do lots of different stuff with (a swiss army knife if you will), rather than as a simple tool for my degree. I have been experimenting a lot in the past year with RMarkdown, creating single HTML pages, in the comfort of my own laptop. I had this big ambition at the back of my mind, of one day publishing a website. Not one about Quantitative Methods though. I did not go through this, until the beginning of the year of our Lord two thousand and twenty-one.

I suffered a loss at the very end of 2020. I put a lot of work on hold, a lot of work that I was not enjoying one bit. At one point, I had to get back into the groove, as painful and as annoying as it could be. Then one day, a classmate suggested one of our course directors/lecturers creates a syllabus with all the different methods we learned throughout the degree. I actually had done something similar for my personal use, but I figured "why not share it and improve it?". And that is when I thought back to this idea of a website: I needed a project, I needed something fun and worthwhile to put my efforts into. I also could not be bothered to work.

I love to procrastinate. The result of this procrastination stint: this project.

### About this project

This has been a little experimentation using R, RMarkdown and bookdown to create a personal blog where I could upload some of my study notes. It is still a work in progress and it is not to be taken as a reference.

If you are curious about the content of my notes, here are the links to get to them. You can send edit suggestions if needed!

One last word: the notes are in French. I love English, but not to the point of translating course content :-)
