This has been a little experimentation of mine, using R, RMarkdown and bookdown to create a personal website where I could upload some of my postgraduate studies notes. It's still a work in progress and nothing serious, but I enjoy tweaking stuff very much. 

If you are curious about the content of my notes, here are the links to get to them. I'm still figuring out how to let others comment and create commits/pull requests and all that jazz, directly on my notes, but in the meantime feel free to send suggestions via my GitHub profile!

Last note: my notes are in French. I love English, but not to the point of translating course content :-)
