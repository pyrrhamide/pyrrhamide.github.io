A classmate suggested one of our course directors/lecturers creates a syllabus with all the different methods we learned throughout the degree. I had done something similar for my personal use, which prompted me to improve and share it to help my coursemates out.

I wrote two books with R, RMarkdown and the [`bookdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) package, and used GitHub Pages to deploy them. It is still a work in progress.

One last word: the notes are in French.

## The books

* [Régressions - toutes les méthodes du master](https://pyrrhamide.github.io/regressions),
* [Analyses longitudinales - retranscription des notes de cours](https://pyrrhamide.github.io/analyses-longitudinales).
