title: About me
---

I am currently a postgraduate student in Quantified Social Sciences, having previously studied Politics and Quantitative Methods.

I am French. I love tattoos, rugby, reality TV and Swiss army knives.

I started to use R last year, as part of my studies. I've been having a blast, especially once I began experimenting with RMarkdown by creating single HTML pages in the comfort of my own laptop. I thought about publishing a website at some point, because local browsing rapidly became bothersome. I decided to take the leap in 2021: I launched my [personal blog](http://kanto.rbind.io) built with the `blogdown` package, and the following project with `bookdown`.

## About this project

A classmate suggested one of our course directors/lecturers creates a syllabus with all the different methods we learned throughout the degree. I had done something similar for my personal use, which prompted me to improve and share it to help my coursemates out. 

I wrote two books with R, RMarkdown and the [`bookdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) package, and used GitHub Pages to deploy them. It is still a work in progress.

One last word: the notes are in French.

## The books
