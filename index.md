I am currently a postgraduate student in Quantified Social Sciences, having previously studied Politics and Quantitative Methods.

I am French. I love tattoos, rugby, reality TV and Swiss army knives.

Last year, as part of my studies, I started to use R. The learning curve was steep, but once I understood what I was doing, R became a versatile toy (a swiss army knife if you will) rather than just a tool for my degree. I have been experimenting with RMarkdown, creating single HTML pages, in the comfort of my own laptop. I had this ambition of one day publishing a website, because local browsing rapidly became bothersome. I went through with this at the beginning of the year of our Lord two thousand and twenty-one.

A classmate suggested one of our course directors/lecturers creates a syllabus with all the different methods we learned throughout the degree. I actually had done something similar for my personal use, and I figured I might as well improve and share it to help my coursemates out. It brought me back to this idea of a website/blog, which I now proudly present.

### About this project

This has been a little experimentation using R, RMarkdown and [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) to create a personal blog where I could upload some of my study notes. It is still a work in progress and it is not to be taken as a reference. Do feel free to send suggestions.

One last word: the notes are in French.
