I am currently a postgraduate student in Quantified Social Sciences, having previously studied Politics and Quantitative Methods.

I started to use R last year, as part of my studies. I've been having a blast, especially once I began experimenting with RMarkdown by creating single HTML pages in the comfort of my own laptop. I thought about publishing a website at some point, because local browsing rapidly became bothersome. I took the leap in 2021: I launched my [personal blog](http://kanto.rbind.io) built with the `blogdown` package, and the following project with `bookdown`.
